# Simple-Games
These are Java programs that serve as simple games. Some games have multiple programs because of slight changes in rules, such as the High-Low
games. Some programs are inspired by the book, "Learn Java the Easy Way" by Bryson Payne. The game specifics are listed below...

GuessingGame.java expands on HighLow.java but uses a GUI to create a friendly-user experience. The range is between -100 and 100 and the user tries to guess the randomly
generated value.

HighLow.java is a range between -100 and 100. Guess the randomly generated number in this range.

HighLow2.java is a range between 1 and 10. Guess the randomly generated number in this range.

HighLow3.java is a range between 0 and 1,000,000. Guess the randomly generated number in this range.

MadLibs.java is a game that asks for specific string variables to complete the madlib.
