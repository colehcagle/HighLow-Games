# Simple-Games
These are Java programs that serve as simple games. Some games have multiple programs because of slight changes in rules, such as the High-Low
games. Some programs are inspired by the book, "Learn Java the Easy Way" by Bryson Payne. The game specifics are listed below...

GuessingGame.java expands on HighLow.java but uses a GUI to create a user-friendly experience. The range is between -100 and 100 and the user tries to guess the randomly
generated value.

HighLow.java is a range between -100 and 100. Guess the randomly generated number in this range.

HighLow2.java is a range between 1 and 10. Guess the randomly generated number in this range.

HighLow3.java is a range between 0 and 1,000,000. Guess the randomly generated number in this range.

MadLibs.java is a game that asks for specific string variables to complete the madlib.

SecretMessages.java is a fun messaging game that allows the user to enter one or more messages for encryption/decryption. User can also pick the secret key of their 
choosing between -25 and 25. Currently, letters A through Z, a through z, and digits 0 through 9 are supported.

SecretMessagesGUI.java expands on SecretMessages.java, except uses a GUI for a user-friendly experience. Simply, type in a message and use the slider or text field to
select an encryption key. Then, click the button to encrypt the message. Or you can do the reverse and decrypt the message.
